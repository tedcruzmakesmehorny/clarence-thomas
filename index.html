		<h1>Wow, I can't believe I want to have sex with Clarence Thomas!</h1>
		<p>It's not hard to imagine why though!</p>
		<h2>Clarence Thomas, please keep sodomy legal so we can have legal anal sex together!</h2>
		<p>I can't believe Clarence Thomas and I are going to have <strong>aNaL sex</strong> together! Wow! Please wait for us to have anal before you overturn Lawrence v. Texas, Clarence~!</p>
		<marquee><h2 style = 'color:yellow;'>NEWS ALERT!</h2></marquee> 
		<h3>Clarence THomas wrote the majority opinion overturning Roe v Wade so that I <u><i>COULDN'T</i></u> abort our love child???</h3>
		<p>Ha ha! Who would want to exercise their human right to control their own body when it's <i>you</i> C.T.! You turn me on so much that I would keep the child even if you were my brother, or our sex <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh#:~:text=Christine%20Blasey%20Ford%2C%20a%20psychology,they%20were%20in%20high%20school.'>wasn't consentual</a>, or if giving birth was going to kill me! That's how much I want to have sex with Clarence Thomas.</p>

		<h2>An Open Letter to Clarence Thomas:</h2>
		<p><i>Dear Clarence Thomas,<br/><br/>I would like to have sex with you.<br/><br/>Love,<br/>The entire country</i></p>
		<hr/>
		<h2>WHY IS THERE SO MUCH SEX APPEAL ON THE SUPREME COURT??</h2>
		<p>I don't know, but I just can't stop fantasizing about his honorable clarence thomas or his big gavel! And Brett Kavanaugh is such a <small><del>maybe rapist who lied during his confirmation hearing</del></small> beefcake too!! </p>
		<h2>Is gay marriage next???</h2>
		<p>It really gets me hot when you overturn established legal precedent and make a sexy mockery of the supreme court, but please don't overturn Obergefell v. Hodges because if you do we can't get married and every night I lie in bed thinking about you falling asleep with me, just like you fall asleep during oral arguments. And when we're married, we'll have lots of <u>oral</u> <i>arguments</i>!</P>

			<h1>This site is a joke, but the danger to women, people of color, and homosexuals isn't.</h1>
			<p>Undermining rights established by landmark decisions like Roe v. Wade and Lawrence v. Texas undermines all of our freedom, and puts the already vulnerable in material danger.</p>
			<p>According to Thomas, <quote>"The underlying theory... that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well
as procedural, protection for “liberty”—has long been controversial."</quote></p>
			<p>But make no mistake that this ruling is not about "fixing" the legal understanding of the 14th amendment. This is a bad faith effort by the Republican Party to advance an agenda and ideology that for 50 years has been protected by morality and legal precedent.</p>
			<h2>State's Rights are Not Enough</h2>
			<p>The right of a state to define what they believe are and aren't human rights greatest effects the most vulnerable segments of society. Anyone who says, "it's still legal in other states," ignore the people in now/soon to be abortionless states that lack the resources to travel to clinics in other states, or, who will soon be considered in violation of the law for leaving their home state to get an abortion.</p>
			<h2>Shame on you, Clarence Thomas, shame on the Supreme Court.</h2>
