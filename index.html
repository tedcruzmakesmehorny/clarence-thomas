		<h1>Wow, I can't believe I want to have sex with Clarence Thomas!</h1>
		<p>It's not hard to imagine why though!</p>
		<h2>Clarence Thomas, please keep sodomy legal so we can have legal anal sex together!</h2>
		<p>I can't believe Clarence Thomas and I are going to have consentual anal sex together! Wow!</p>
		<marquee><h2 style = 'color:yellow;'>NEWS ALERT!</h2></marquee> 
		<h3>Clarence THomas wrote the majority opinion overturning Roe v Wade so that I <u><i>COULDN'T</i></u> abort our love child???</h3>
		<p>Ha ha! Who would want to exercise their human right to control their own body when it's <i>you</i> C.T.! You turn me on so much that I would keep the child even if you were my brother, or our sex <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Hill#:~:text=After%20interviewing%20a%20number%20of,lied%20during%20his%20confirmation%20process.'>wasn't consentual</a>, or if giving birth was going to kill me! That's how much I want to have sex with Clarence Thomas.</p>

		<h2>An Open Letter to Clarence Thomas:</h2>
		<p><i>Dear Clarence Thomas,<br/><br/>I would like to have sex with you.<br/><br/>Love,<br/>The entire country</i></p>

		<h2>WHY IS THERE SO MUCH SEX APPEAL ON THE SUPREME COURT??</h2>
		<p>I don't know, but I just can't stop fantasizing about his honorable clarence thomas or his big gavel! And Brett Kavanaugh is such a <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh#:~:text=Christine%20Blasey%20Ford%2C%20a%20psychology,they%20were%20in%20high%20school.'>sex machine too!</a> </p>
		<h2>Is gay marriage next???</h2>
		<p>It really gets me hot when you overturn established legal precedent and make a sexy mockery of the supreme court, but please don't overturn Obergefell v. Hodges because if you do we can't get married and every night I lie in bed thinking about you falling asleep with me, just like you fall asleep during oral arguments. And when we're married, we'll have lots of <u>oral</u> <i>arguments</i>!</P>
